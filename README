smallscheme
===========

smallpython is scheme interpreter written in python. I create this project
just for educational purposes. I have had two goals:

- Make it run
- Make it run examples from "The Little Schemer"

Features
========

- Tail recursion
- Closures
- Numbers (Just integers -- no floats).
- Strings (But no functions to deal with them...)
- Symbols
- Booleans
- REPL
- File Interpreter
